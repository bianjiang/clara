	<!--
		Turn on AspectJ @Configurable support. As a result, any time you
		instantiate an object, Spring will attempt to perform dependency
		injection on that object. This occurs for instantiation via the "new"
		keyword, as well as via reflection. This is possible because AspectJ
		is used to "weave" Roo-based applications at compile time. In effect
		this feature allows dependency injection of any object at all in your
		system, which is a very useful feature (without @Configurable you'd
		only be able to dependency inject objects acquired from Spring or
		subsequently presented to a specific Spring dependency injection
		method). Roo applications use this useful feature in a number of
		areas, such as @PersistenceContext injection into entities.
	-->
	<context:spring-configured />

	<!--
		This declaration will cause Spring to locate every @Component,
		@Repository and @Service in your application. In practical terms this
		allows you to write a POJO and then simply annotate the new POJO as an
		@Service and Spring will automatically detect, instantiate and
		dependency inject your service at startup time. Importantly, you can
		then also have your new service injected into any other class that
		requires it simply by declaring a field for your service inside the
		relying class and Spring will inject it. Note that two exclude filters
		are declared. The first ensures that Spring doesn't spend time
		introspecting Roo-specific ITD aspects. The second ensures Roo doesn't
		instantiate your @Controller classes, as these should be instantiated
		by a web tier application context. Refer to web.xml for more details
		about the web tier application context setup services. Furthermore,
		this turns on @Autowired, @PostConstruct etc support. These
		annotations allow you to use common Spring and Java Enterprise Edition
		annotations in your classes without needing to do any special
		configuration. The most commonly used annotation is @Autowired, which
		instructs Spring to dependency inject an object into your class.
